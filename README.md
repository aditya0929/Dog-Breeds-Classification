Approach for this Project :

**Image segmentation**

is a crucial task in computer vision that involves identifying and classifying different regions or objects within an image. In this project, I will explore three different approaches for image segmentation using deep learning models: **VGG19**, **MobileNet** and **ResNet50V2**.


`ResNet50V2` 

I have implemented a ResNet50V2 model for image classification using Keras. The ResNet50V2 model, pre-trained on the **ImageNet dataset**, serves as a powerful feature extractor. By freezing the pre-trained layers and adding additional layers for classification, we were able to achieve good performance on our image classification task.

`MobileNet` 

By utilizing **transfer learning** with the MobileNet model, we can leverage pre-trained weights and significantly reduce the training time required for our image classification task. This approach is particularly useful when working with limited training data, as we can benefit from the rich representations learned by the base model on a large-scale dataset like ImageNet.
